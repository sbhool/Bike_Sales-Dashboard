This project is to analyze the customer behaviour in the bike industry

Here are some key insights:

The data reveals a positive correlation between average income and bike purchases. Interestingly, males tend to purchase more bikes than females.

2. Commute Distance vs. Bike Purchases:
The highest number of bike purchases is for commutes within 0-1 miles. However, as the commute distance increases, especially beyond 10 miles, bike purchases significantly drop.

3. Age vs. Bike Purchases:
Middle-aged individuals are the most active bike purchasers, indicating that this age group values biking for commute.

4.Occupation vs. Bike Purchases:
Professional people are purhcasing more bikes as compared to the other profession.

5. North america people are more bike lovers as compared to Europe and Pacific.

Additionally, I've incorporated slicers for marital status, region, and education to provide a more granular analysis.
